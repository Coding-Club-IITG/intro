Jump to [list](https://github.com/Coding-Club-IITG/intro#list-of-repos-up-for-contribution) of repos up for contribution. <br>
What is this?
 - This is a guide to get started with contributing to the some open source projects. 
 - Its main aim is to get participants started with contributions to open source projects and introducing them to the basic flow of the pull request model.
<br>

## What is open source?
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
## Why participate?
 - Open source work sharpens your skills in ways you never realized were dull—from writing cleaner, more maintainable code to learning how to communicate well and work as a team.  <br>
 - It's also the best possible resume builder for a working or aspiring professional developer; potential employers can hit your repository and see what you're capable of, and developers you've worked with on community projects may want to bring you in on paying gigs.<br>
 - Ultimately, working on open source projects—yours or others'—means personal growth, because you're working on something larger than yourself.
